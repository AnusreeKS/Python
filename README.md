# Python

## Assignment 1 : Fundamentals
     Contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Python Fundamentals" with various Python exercises aimed at building a strong foundation in the language. 
     It includes examples and solutions to essential programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Assignment 2 :Data Structures

    This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled " Data Structures" focused on practical exercises for understanding Python's data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and more.

### Contents

The notebook is divided into sections, each targeting a specific data structure and its use cases:

Lists: Creating and manipulating lists.Operations like inserting a new value and then printing each element of the list with a loop.

Dictionaries:Creating a dictionary and adding a new key:value pair to the existing dictionary.

Sets:Performing set operations like creating a set, adding a new value to the set and removing a value from the set.

Tuples:Creating a tuple and then printing its length.

## Assignment 3 : Conditional and Looping Statements
  This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Conditional & Looping Statements" focused on mastering Python's control flow mechanisms through practical exercises.

### Contents

The notebook is divided into sections covering:

Conditional Statements: Using if, elif, and else. Nested conditionals and logical operators.

Loops:for loops for iteration.while loops for condition-based repetition. Nested loops for multi-level iteration.

Various problems like finding factorial, calculating required results from user input and categorising the results and printing the result, reversing a number, 
printing a required series etc are done with conditional and looping statements.

## Assignment 4 - Functions
     This file contains code that is written to deeply understand the use of 
     User Defined Functions as well as Built -in Functions in python

### Contents

1) Explains that len(), a built-in function in Python, which returns the number of elements in objects like lists, tuples, strings, etc
2) Defining and Using a Simple Function (greet()). The greet() function, defines  a function that takes a name as input and prints a greeting.
3) max_list() is a user defined function to find the maximum value from a user given list of numbers. The try and except blocks are used for exception handling.
   It handle errors from the user end if they are not inputing a number list.
4)A code to differentiate between global and local variables in Python.
5) Code to explain how we can set a default value to a variable in a UDF in Python.
