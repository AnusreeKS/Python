# Python

## Assignment 1 : Fundamentals
     Contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Python Fundamentals" with various Python exercises aimed at building a strong foundation in the language. 
     It includes examples and solutions to essential programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Assignment 2 :Data Structures

    This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled " Data Structures" focused on practical exercises for understanding Python's data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and more.

### Contents

The notebook is divided into sections, each targeting a specific data structure and its use cases:

Lists: Creating and manipulating lists.Operations like inserting a new value and then printing each element of the list with a loop.

Dictionaries:Creating a dictionary and adding a new key:value pair to the existing dictionary.

Sets:Performing set operations like creating a set, adding a new value to the set and removing a value from the set.

Tuples:Creating a tuple and then printing its length.

## Assignment 3 : Conditional and Looping Statements
  This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Conditional & Looping Statements" focused on mastering Python's control flow mechanisms through practical exercises.

### Contents

The notebook is divided into sections covering:

Conditional Statements: Using if, elif, and else. Nested conditionals and logical operators.

Loops:for loops for iteration.while loops for condition-based repetition. Nested loops for multi-level iteration.

Various problems like finding factorial, calculating required results from user input and categorising the results and printing the result, reversing a number, 
printing a required series etc are done with conditional and looping statements.

## Assignment 4 - Functions
     This file contains code that is written to deeply understand the use of 
     User Defined Functions as well as Built -in Functions in python

### Contents

1) Explains that len(), a built-in function in Python, which returns the number of elements in objects like lists, tuples, strings, etc
2) Defining and Using a Simple Function (greet()). The greet() function, defines  a function that takes a name as input and prints a greeting.
3) max_list() is a user defined function to find the maximum value from a user given list of numbers. The try and except blocks are used for exception handling.
   It handle errors from the user end if they are not inputing a number list.
4)A code to differentiate between global and local variables in Python.
5) Code to explain how we can set a default value to a variable in a UDF in Python.
   
## Assignment 5 : Exception Handling
     This file demonstrates exception handling techniques in Python.

### Contents

1) Reading a File: Demonstrates how to read a file and handle exceptions if the file is missing.
2) Exception Handling Mechanisms: Uses try-except to manage runtime errors effectively.
3) Handling common exceptions like FileNotFoundError, ZeroDivisionError etc.
4) Includes real-world examples like functions to find average of a list of nubmers, to check whether a list contains a negative number of not etc
   to improve error resilience in Python applications.

## Assignment 6 : OOPs in Python
      This fiel explores OOP principles by defining and working with classes and objects. Key concepts include:

          Creating and using classes and objects.
          Implementing inheritance for specialized class behaviors.
          Using method overriding for customization.

### Contents

     1)Course Catalog: Defines a base class Course and its subclasses CoreCourse and ElectiveCourse.
     2)Inheritance and Method Overriding: Demonstrates how subclasses extend the behavior of the base class.
     3)Practical OOP Applications: Implements real-world OOP scenarios for better understanding.


## Assignment 7 - NumPy and Pandas
      This project contains solutions to a set of exercises involving NumPy and Pandas, covering data manipulation, analysis, and transformation tasks.

### Contents

     1)NumPy Array Creation and Reshaping
     	Create a NumPy array from 1 to 10 and reshape it into a 2x5 matrix.

     2)Extract Elements from a NumPy Array
          Create a NumPy array with values from 1 to 20 and extract elements between the 5th and 15th index.

     3)Pandas Series Manipulation
          Create a Pandas Series with fruit quantities and add a new item.

     4)Pandas DataFrame Creation
          Create a DataFrame with name, age, and gender columns with 10 rows of data.

     5)Adding a New Column
          Add an occupation column to the previously created DataFrame.

     6)Filtering Data
          Select rows where the age is greater than or equal to 30.

     7)CSV File Operations
          Convert the DataFrame to a CSV file, read it back, and display its contents.
