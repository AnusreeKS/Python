# Python

## Assignment 1 : Fundamentals
     Contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Python Fundamentals" with various Python exercises aimed at building a strong foundation in the language. 
     It includes examples and solutions to essential programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.

## Asiignment 2 :Data Structures

    This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled " Data Structures" focused on practical exercises for understanding Python's data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and more.

### Contents

The notebook is divided into sections, each targeting a specific data structure and its use cases:

Lists: Creating and manipulating lists.Operations like inserting a new value and then printing each element of the list with a loop.

Dictionaries:Creating a dictionary and adding a new key:value pair to the existing dictionary.

Sets:Performing set operations like creating a set, adding a new value to the set and removing a value from the set.

Tuples:Creating a tuple and then printing its length.

## Assignment 3 : Conditional and Looping Statements
  This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook titled "Conditional & Looping Statements" focused on mastering Python's control flow mechanisms through practical exercises.

Contents

The notebook is divided into sections covering:

Conditional Statements: Using if, elif, and else. Nested conditionals and logical operators.

Loops:for loops for iteration.while loops for condition-based repetition. Nested loops for multi-level iteration.

Various problems like finding factorial, calculating required results from user input and categorising the results and printing the result, reversing a number, printing a required series etc are done with conditional and looping statements.
