     2)Extract Elements from a NumPy Array
          Create a NumPy array with values from 1 to 20 and extract elements between the 5th and 15th index.

     3)Pandas Series Manipulation
          Create a Pandas Series with fruit quantities and add a new item.

     4)Pandas DataFrame Creation
          Create a DataFrame with name, age, and gender columns with 10 rows of data.

     5)Adding a New Column
          Add an occupation column to the previously created DataFrame.

     6)Filtering Data
          Select rows where the age is greater than or equal to 30.

     7)CSV File Operations
          Convert the DataFrame to a CSV file, read it back, and display its contents.


## Assignment 8 - Data Visualisation
      This project contains three data visualization exercises using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
      The goal is to create different types of charts to analyze and represent given datasets.

# Module Assignment - Employee Data Analysis

## Overview
          This project involves analyzing a dataset from ABC Company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns.
          The objective is to preprocess the dataset, perform analytical tasks, and present insights through visualizations.
          The project demonstrates proficiency in Python programming, data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and data visualization.
          
          
### Preprocessing Steps
          •	Corrected the "height" column by replacing values with random numbers between 150 and 180.
          •	Ensured data consistency and integrity before analysis.
          
### Analysis Tasks
          1.	Employee Distribution by Team:
               o	Calculated the number of employees in each team.
               o	Determined the percentage split relative to the total employees.
          2.	Segregation by Position:
               o	Categorized employees based on their positions within the company.
          3.	Predominant Age Group:
               o	Identified the most common age range among employees.
          4.	Highest Salary Expenditure:
               o	Determined which team and position had the highest salary allocation.
          5.	Correlation between Age and Salary:
               o	Analyzed and visually represented the relationship between age and salary.
               
### Graphical Representations
          For each analysis task, appropriate visualizations were created, including:
               •	Bar charts for employee distribution and salary expenditure.
               •	Pie charts for percentage-based distributions.
               •	Histograms for age group analysis.
               •	Scatter plots to identify correlations.

               
### Insights Gained
          •	Identified key trends in employee distribution and salary allocation.
          •	Discovered patterns in employee positions and age groups.
          •	Established relationships between different variables, aiding business decision-making
